# Production-Planning-Nonlinear-Optimization-AMPL
A nonlinear optimization project concerned with maximising revenues for a production plan, subject to nonlinear constraints, for a hypothetical oil refinery seeking to optimise the fuel oils.  The production is carried out across 3 production stages (distillation, pooling and blending) which separate 4 sets of products (crude oils, intermediate products, tank products and final products).  We investigate optimal solutions to our problem in AMPL and then consider more subtle questions about our solutions in the corresponding report.
